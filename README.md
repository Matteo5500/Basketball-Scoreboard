# 🏀 Basketball Scoreboard

A simple and functional digital scoreboard for tracking points during basketball games — built by a player, for players.

## 🎯 Why I Created It

I'm passionate about basketball and play regularly. During casual games with friends or training sessions, I often found myself keeping score by memory or scribbling it on paper. I wanted something simple, visible, and interactive — so I decided to build this **digital scoreboard**.

It's designed to work on any device: tablet, PC, or even smartphone, so you can always keep track of the score in a clear and intuitive way.

## 🛠️ Features

- Two sections: **HOME** and **GUEST**
- Score updates via `+1`, `+2`, `+3` buttons
- Responsive and centered layout
- Clean design with high-contrast colors
- Simple, readable code — perfect for learning or customizing

## 📦 Technologies Used

- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for styling and layout
- **JavaScript** for interactive logic

This project was inspired by a Scrimba. I customized it to fit my own needs as a basketball player.
